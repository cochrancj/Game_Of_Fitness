    <h2>Welcome Nerds!</h2>
    <p>Let's play a game - a fitness game. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to level up your fitness - one (not-so-standard) deck of cards at a time. </p>
    <p>Each card you complete earns mana points (for example: a card requiring 2 reps earns 2 mana; one requiring 25 reps earns 25 mana) and each completed round earns you inventory.</p>
    <p>You can cash out after any round, but keep in mind ... </p>
    <p>The more mana you get; the quicker you'll earn a boss battle level - plus, the more inventory you accure; the better you'll do.  </p>
    <p>Sign up, pick your class & guild, and get to work! </p>
